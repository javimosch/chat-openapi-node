# Add CSV support

Improve chunking/embedding/similarity-match by supporting CSV files instead of JSON.

## Scope

- 1.1 The chunking logic should be able to process CSV files as well as JSON files
- 1.2 The embedding logic should be able to process CSV files as well as JSON files
- 1.3 The upload view should be able to process CSV files as well as JSON files (Will use new logic added in 1.1 and 1.2)
- 1.4 There is an ENV variable to toggle chat between JSON and CSV mode.
- 1.5 The new ENV variable should be called 'INPUT_FORMAT'
- 1.6 The default value should be JSON
- 1.7 The chat interface should be able to process a new message and perform a similarity search and context retrieval taking into account current setting (INPUT_FORMAT)
- 1.8 There is a new settings page where we can switch between JSON and CSV mode (INPUT_FORMAT) and persistance is localStorage based
